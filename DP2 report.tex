\section{Introduction}

When deployed to a disaster-stricken area, first responders need to be able to efficiently communicate their location and other 
information to their base camp. However, communication infrastructure is often unreliable or inaccessible during these crises. 
To solve this problem, we design an ad-hoc wireless network of portable devices that allows responders to send messages to their 
base camp in a reliable, efficient, and safe way. Our rigorous design accounts for the rapid changes in network topology that 
occur as the responders move around, as well as the possible presence of malicious agents in the field.
